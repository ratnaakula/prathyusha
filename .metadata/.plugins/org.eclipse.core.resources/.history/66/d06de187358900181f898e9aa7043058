 /**(Financial application: loan amortization schedule) The monthly payment for a given loan pays the 
 principal and the interest. The monthly interest is computed by multiplying the monthly interest rate and the balance 
 (the remaining principal). The principal paid for the month is therefore the monthly payment 
 minus the monthly interest. Write a program that lets the user enter the loan amount, number of years, and interestRate and displays
 the amortization schedule for the loan.**/
