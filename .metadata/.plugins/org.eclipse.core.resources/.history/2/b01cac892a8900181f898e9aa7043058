/**(Financial application: compute future tuition)
Suppose that the tuition for a university is $10,000 this year and increases 5% every year.
In one year, the tuition will be $10,500. Write a program that computes the tuition in ten years and 
the total cost of four years’ worth of tuition after the tenth year.*/
